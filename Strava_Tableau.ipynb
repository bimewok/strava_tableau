I have been using Strava for a few years and have hundreds of hikes, runs and bike rides logged on the site. Although Strava makes it easy to see a list of your activities on their app, they provide few useful maps and charts to users. Luckily, I can fix that!<br><br> \r\n",

The end goal is a single table with all of the important tabular data and spatial data all in one place, not hundreds of files in different formats. While you can use open source tools to convert .fit files to a more typical spatial format like `.gpx` or `.shp`, I decided to tackle the problem with python in a more interesting way...\r\n",

Conveniently, the url for each activity page is predictable and reproducable if one know the activity name they want to recieve. You can use Strava's API to routinely get these files with authentication, but I found that process no simpler or quicker than making a simple request. Thus, I decided to use python to direct my browser (already logged in to my account) to download each file via the link on the activity webpage. \r\n",
